## Vanilla JS Accordion Script
This is a vanilla JS accordion script, which does not depend on any external libraries. I, (Lisa Williams), wrote this script from scratch.

This script has the following features:
* Deep linking (automatically open an accordion based on URL hash)
* Link to an accordion on the same page, and have it open the accordion
* All features should work for nested accordions
* Accessibility built in (aria-expanded attribute)

## Included Files
* Very base visual styling that you can change (accordion-active.png, accordion-inactive.png, accordion.css, accordion.min.css)
* HTML file with sample markup (index.html; general markup needs to stay the same as what's in this file in order for the script to work)
* The actual accordion script (accordion.js, accordion.min.js)
